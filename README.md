# FORO  Forest(ry) ontology

## Disclosure
If something like this does not exist, I would like to create a group to produce this.
If there is a similar resource available, please let us know.

## Purpose
To improve interoperability of data and information systems as well as concept and terminology harmonization by
- providing permanent identifiers for central forest(ry) concepts
- find the corresponding terms in multiple languages, cultures and traditions
- map the concepts to the other major terminological sources available online such as Wikidata, Agrovoc, Eurovoc, Gemet

## Organization
This could be accomplished under the IUFRO unit [9.01.01 - Library, information networks and terminology](https://www.iufro.org/science/divisions/division-9/90000/90100/90101/)  currently lead by Dr. G. Petrokofsky

## Platform
Editorial tool is still undecided.  Would like to have an multiuser online-skos/RDF-editor.
Any suggestions are welcome. 

## Data sources
Forest-related vocabularies have been published regularly over the last 120 years. Only few are available online and most do not provide identifiers for the concepts so that they could be mapped. Some of the existing vocabularies online are e.g.
- [Lexicon Forestale](http://hdl.handle.net/10138/27720) - multilingual, but a little outdated thesaurus in fi,sv,en,de,ru
- [SilvaTerm](https://www.iufro.org/science/special/silvavoc/silvaterm/) - multilingual terminological database of forestry concepts 
  - Search form: https://www.iufro.org/science/special/silvavoc/silvaterm/query-silvaterm-database/
